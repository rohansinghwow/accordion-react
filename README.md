# Accordion in React and Tailwind CSS 

The default template project for [nano-react-app](https://github.com/nano-react-app/nano-react-app).

- `npm start` — This will spawn a development server with a default port of `3000`.
- `npm run build` — This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.

## Custom port

You can use the `-p` flag to specify a port for development. To do this, you can either run `npm start` with an additional flag:

```
npm start -- --port 1234
```

Or edit the `start` script directly:

```
vite --port 1234
```
# How it works
- A default state of false is set in each accordian
- Conditonal rendering is used based on state to render info or not
- Show / Hide button is also rendered conditionally by state
